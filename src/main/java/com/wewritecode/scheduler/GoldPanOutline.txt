class: RequestController
    see cs48-post-diagram.svg for details

Option 1: Genetic Algorithm
    Preconditions:
        - RequestController has mapped the POST request into two JSON objects:
            - baseSchedule.json
                - Includes lectures/sections that MUST be present in any generated schedule, as including the course
                  leaves only the one option for the lecture or section.
            - schedulePan.json
                - Includes courses with lecture/sections that have more than one option.
            * Note: baseSchedule.json and schedulePan.json MUST be independent of each other. If there is a lecture
              in baseSchedule.json for a specific course, that lecture must NOT present in schedulePan.json
        - No exceptions have been thrown up to this point.

        Example:
            - Courses: courseA, courseB, courseC
                - courseA
                    - lecture1
                        - sectionA, sectionB
                    - lecture2
                        - sectionA, sectionB
                - courseB
                    - lecture1
                        - sectionA, sectionB
                - courseC
                    - lecture1
                        - sectionA
                    - lecture2
                        - sectionA
